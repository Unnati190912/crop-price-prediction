# Python Program Setup and Run Guide (Windows)

This guide explains how to set up and run a Python program on Windows using Flask, scikit-learn, and NumPy.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python 3.x**: You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip**: Python's package manager (usually included with Python).

### Step 1: Check Python Installation

To verify that Python is installed, open a **Command Prompt** and type:

```bash
python --version
If Python is not installed, download and install it from Python Downloads.

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
To avoid package conflicts, it's a good idea to create a virtual environment for your project.

Open Command Prompt and navigate to your project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd path\to\your\project
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
You should see (venv) appear at the beginning of your prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

Step 3: Install Required Packages
Use pip to install Flask, scikit-learn, and NumPy.

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask scikit-learn numpy
Step 4: Verify Installation
You can verify that the packages have been installed by listing installed packages:

bash
Copy code
pip list
You should see Flask, scikit-learn, and numpy in the list.

Step 5: Running the Python Program
Ensure you're in the project directory where your Python program is located.

Run the Python script using the python command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Replace app.py with the name of your Python file if it's different.

If you are using Flask, the output will provide a URL (such as http://127.0.0.1:5000/). Open your browser and go to this URL to access the Flask web application.

Step 6: Deactivating the Virtual Environment
After running your program, you can deactivate the virtual environment by typing:

bash
Copy code
deactivate
Troubleshooting
Package not found: If pip cannot find a package, make sure you are using the correct spelling and capitalization.
Python not recognized: If python is not recognized, you may need to add Python to your systemâ€™s PATH.
